Here is an overview of South Korea's major public transportation systems that I can recommend to travelers, along with descriptions of the public transit in 5 major cities:

South Korea has very convenient, efficient and affordable public transportation around the country. The main options are subway systems, public buses, and trains. Taxis are also easy to hail.  

In major cities like Seoul and Busan, the subway system, or metro, is the fastest and easiest way to travel. The stations have signs and announcements in English. Buses reach more neighborhoods and routes connect all over the cities and surrounding suburbs. 

For traveling between cities and provinces, the KTX high-speed rail offers a comfortable and fast option. Slow and express buses also drive all domestic routes.

Seoul has one of the world's most advanced subway systems covering the entire city and surrounding areas with 10 quick, clean and safe metro lines that are easy to navigate. 

Busan, the 2nd largest city, has a 4-line metro system that conveniently connects spots like Haeundae Beach, major hotels, downtown, malls and public markets. Buses fill remaining routes.

Incheon houses Incheon International Airport and also has two modern light rail metro lines to help visitors travel in and around its metropolitan areas and to Seoul efficiently.

Daegu city offers a simple metro consisting of one red and one blue line that cuts across downtown with transfers that can bring travelers conveniently to and from Busan and Seoul through its high speed train stations. 

The city of Daejeon has a single metro line crossing north to south through downtown that makes stops at government buildings, universities and shopping areas that connect to national and regional train systems like the KTX.

I'm happy to provide any other public transportation information to help visitors get around South Korea's amazing sites with ease and enjoyment! Let me know if you need any other recommendations or advice.
